 *
 * Task:
 * - Create a new scene and assign it to a variable
 * - Create a new PerspectiveCamera and assign it to a variable,
 * - Uncomment the lines where we initialize the camera to a position and an angle
 *
 * Hints:
 * - All the parameters for setting up the camera are defined as variables above. You can play around with these
 * later!

 * ====== TASK 2 ======
 * Your still seeing a red canvas. That is because we have not told Three.js to draw anything to the screen yet. Lets
 * fix that!
 *
 * The WebGLRenderer is responsible for drawing the scene on the canvas, viewed from the cameras position
 *
 * Docs: https://threejs.org/docs/?q=web#api/en/renderers/WebGLRenderer
 *
 * Task:
 * - Initialize the WebGLRenderer with the canvas as a parameter
 * - Call the render() function on the renderer with the required parameters
 *
 * HINT: The WebGLRenderer expects its parameters inside a javascript object. An example of a js object is this:
 *
 * const myObject = {
 *   someKey: 1337,
 *   anotherKey: 42,
 *   thisIsAThirdKey: 9001
 * }
 *
 * Try to put the canvas inside an object where the key is canvas and the value is the canvas!

/**
 * ====== TASK 3 ======
 * YAY! Three.js has taken over the drawing of the canvas – which you can see because the screen has turned black
 * instead of red.
 *
 * But a black screen isn't *that* much more interesting than a red one... Let's add something to look at!
 *
 * Task:
 * - Use the example code from these docs to add a box to the scene
 *   https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/geometries/BoxGeometry
 * - Make sure to call the render() method on the renderer again to tell three.js to render what we have given it
 * */

//Your code here

/**
 * ====== TASK 4 ======
 * Nice, we now have a cube, but it is so blurry!! We need to tell three.js what resolution we want things in.
 *
 * Task:
 * - Use the setSize() method on the renderer to set the renderer size to match the canvas
 * - (Did you remember to call render() again after changing the resolution?)
 *
 * Tip: The canvas size can be found as the properties canvas.clientWidth and canvas.clientHeight
 *
 * */

/**
 * ====== TASK 5 ======
 * Animation loop
 * You probably think it is annoying to have to write renderer.render every time you add something to the scene
 * We can ask your browser to call this function 60 times per second automatically
 *
 * Task:
 * - Add the renderer.render function call into the animate function.
 * - Remove the manual renderer.render function calls you have already written, and see that this works
 * - Play around with setting the position of the cube and see how it automatically updates
 *
 * Note:
 * This will draw the scene all the time. In production environments you most likely want to be smart about
 * when you actually call render(), to avoid rendering when there are no updates to the scene, to
 * save computation time for other important tasks.

/**
 * ====== TASK 6 ======
 * It would be nice to be able to move the camera around. This is a bit complicated, but luckily Three.js has an
 * example we can use out of the box which works well enough for this course. It can be added by creating a
 * "new OrbitControls()"
 *
 * OrbitControls work by taking in the camera and the canvas and listening to mouse events on the canvas to calculate
 * how far to move or rotate the camera – which it does by mutating properties on the passed-in camera.
 *
 * Task:
 * - Create new OrbitControls and assign it to a variable `controls` so we can reference it later.
 *   Pass it the canvas we defined above as the domElement.

 * Sweet, we can now move the camera around with the mouse!

 * Task:
 * - Set the `color` on the cubes material to "white".

/**
 * ====== TASK 8 ======
 * The shape of the box is just one big blob – that's because the box's material is not affected by lights and that

 * Task:
 * - Scroll up and change where you created the material of the cube from MeshBasicMaterial to MeshLambertMaterial
 * - Create a DirectionalLight https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=direct#api/en/lights/DirectionalLight
 * - Add the light to the scene
 * - Position the light at position (-2, -5, 10)
 *
 * We suggest using an intensity of 0.7
 * Tip: If you want to view where the light is placed, you can add a new DirectionalLightHelper to the scene!

 * ====== TASK 10 ======
 * Let's start building Forma light version!

 * | o | o | o | o |
 * +---+---+---+---+
 * | o | o | o | o |
 * +---+---+---+---+
 * | o | o | o | o |
 * +---+---+---+---+
 * | o | o | o | o |
 * +---+---+---+---+
 *
 * This is our site!
 * Let's start by adding the ground on the site that the buildings can stand on top of.
 * It needs to be as large as the size of the grid. The size of the grid can be found in the GRID_SIZE variable in
 * the constants.ts file!
 *
 * Task:
 * - Create a PlaneGeometry equal to the size of the grid.
 * - Create a MeshLambertMaterial and give it a color if you'd like!
 * - Create a Mesh from the geometry and the material
 * - Add the Mesh to the Scene
 *

 * plane size in the x and y direction.
 *
 * Task:
 * - Set the position of the plane so it is in the positive quadrant of the grid
 *
 * Hint:
 * - Uncomment the line with the AxisHelper to see where the origo of the Scene is
 * - See the file "Plane center position.png" in the public folder to get a sense of what we should do here

 * ====== TASK 11 ======

 * use "controls.target.set()". Finally you must do a "controls.update()".
 * Task:
 * - Make the camera look at the center of the site

 * floors for that cell.
 *
 * This is our domain model, a pure Javascript/Typescript object which does not have anything to do with Three.js.
 * Separating our domain model and the visual rendering is important when the application grows.
 *
 * Task:
 * - Create a grid using our provided Grid class and assign it to a variable `grid`
 * - Use the functions Grid.setCellValue() and Grid.getCellValue() in it to set the number of floors for a position
 *   of your choice.
 * - Check that it worked by console.log()ing the result (console.log prints things to the browser's console. Google
 * "how to open console in my browser" to figure out how! :)

 * Task:
 * - Uncomment the two lines below

 * ====== TASK 14 ======
 * Interacting with the scene
 *
 * Until now, we have only programmatically added things to the scene. To make a real tool, we need to allow the user
 * to draw the buildings where they want.
 *
 * We want to add or remove a floor when the user clicks somewhere on the map.
 *
 * Docs: https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/core/Raycaster
 *
 * Task:
 * - Create a Raycaster
 * - Set the Raycaster position using the Raycaster.setFromCamera() function
 * - Use the function Raycaster.intersectObjects() to intersect with the PlaneMesh and the GroupOfBoxes. This function
 *   returns a list of intersections (things ray hit), sorted from closest to the camera to furthest away from the camera
 * - Check if we got any intersections, if yes, get the first one
 * - Use the function worldCoordinatesToGridIndex(intersection.point) to transform this coordinate to the grid index
 * - Get the current number of floors for the given grid cell
 * - Set the number of floors for the given cell to one more than before
 * - Update the GroupOfBoxes to see the result
 *
 * You should now be able to draw new boxes!!!
 *
 * Task: Let the user remove them as well
 * - Check if the shiftKey is pressed while clicking (this can be found on event.shiftKey)
 * - If shift is pressed, subtract one from the current value
 *

 * - We have already implemented the functions "findPositionInCanvas" and "worldCoordinatesToGridIndex" below
 * - Throughout this task, it can be really useful to console.log the variables and test your code in the browser
