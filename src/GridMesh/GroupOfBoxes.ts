     * Tasks:
     * - Create a box like we did earlier, and add it with "this.add(boxMesh)"
     * - Set the size of the box. This is defined by the constant CELL_SIZE. Hint: The height is #floors * CELL_SIZE.z
     * - Like with the plane, the box has origo in the middle of the box. You need to add an offset to the position of
     *   the box to compensate for this.
     * - Position the box according to where in the grid it should be. Use the "gridIndexX", "gridIndexY" and the
     *   CELL_SIZE to calculate this position
     *
     * Hint:
     * - It is easier to visualize if you have it correct if you add multiple buildings to the Grid class in the previous task
     *
     *
     * When done, go back to main.ts and continue on the tasks there
